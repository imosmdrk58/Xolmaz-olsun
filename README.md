> **Dive into a Universe of Manga, Manhwa, and Manhua!**  
> AI Manga Reader is a sleek Next.js web app that transforms how you read manga. Powered by the MangaDex API, it gives you instant access to a huge collection of manga in multiple languages, with flexible reading modes like vertical, horizontal, single, or dual-panel views.  
> What sets it apart is its AI-powered OCR translation (using ***easyocr-js*** package) that instantly translates text from manga images, making foreign-language titles easy to enjoy. Plus, the built-in text-to-speech (TTS) feature offers over 20 customizable voices so you can listen to your favorite manga anywhere, anytime.  
>  
> **New!** The Manga List now features a **Latest Activity Feed** that surfaces recent community discussions and comments from MangaDex forums. Since MangaDex does not provide an API for this, the app uses web scraping of the [MangaDex Latest Activity page](https://forums.mangadex.org/whats-new/latest-activity) to extract manga title, chapter, volume, chapter title, comment author, original post author, and the forum thread where the discussion is happening. Stay connected with real-time fan conversations alongside your manga browsing experience.  
>  
> With trending searches, smart filters, and personalized settings that save your preferences, AI Manga Reader delivers a fast, smooth, and immersive experience on desktop, tablet, and mobile. Whether you’re new to manga or a longtime fan, this app makes reading more accessible and enjoyable than ever. 🚀
